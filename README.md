# RBM
A Python implementation of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine using two different packages: NumPy and PyTorch.

Check the NumPy version first. It contains the least additional features and is easiest to understand. See the Jupyter notebook "testing_rbm_numpy" for a simple example of the usage.

The PyTorch version is considerably more ellaborate and contains a lot of custom features I have added to monitor the progress of learning and gain insight into the learned generative model.
